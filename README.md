keychord
========

A simple proof of concept desktop app, that gives to your keyboard the ability to write letters using key chords.

It works best with the dvorak keyboard layout.

# What does it do

You can hit 'u'+'o' to write 'l' or 'u' + 'h' to write 'r, for example'. Why would you want to do this, you may ask. My hypothesis is that if you write that way (with combinations), as you won't need to move your fingers across the keyboard so much, it may turn out to be more pleasant and efficient way of writing. Also, that way, a keyboard with 8 keys and combinations with maximum of 2 keys is equivalent to a keyboard with 36 keys.

To try the idea, you just need to clone this and ```bundle```. Then run it with ```ruby main.rb```. The 'home keys' are 'a o u e h t n s', the combos are made of them.
